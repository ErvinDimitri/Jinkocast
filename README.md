Creators will now be able to upload their podcasts to a decentralized application and know that their content will always be there and available for their audience. So for that to happen, the application will be empowered by blockchain(By this way, can prove ownership) and IPFS to store the podcasts in a decentralized way. <br> ANother feature is Passwordless authentication which means:
- the creators will not need to define a password
- Don't need to worry, if the password is secure enough.

*Further updates will follow soon...*
